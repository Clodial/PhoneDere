# PhoneDere
Phonedere is like a dating sim/app where all you really do is, tell your app how you feel about it and it will react thusly.

Inspired by classic anime architypes, the app also features the ability to have all sorts of personas for your phone to give their own reactions to what you say!

Currently, in terms of working terms:
Technically, any word and sentence can affect the app, but only 6 words are able to really give you that "phone-dating" experience.
